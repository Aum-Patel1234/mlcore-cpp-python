# mlcore

A core Machine Learning library implemented in C++ with Python bindings via pybind11.

## Overview

This repository is designed as a learning resource to understand how to implement basic ML algorithms and utilities in C++, and expose them to Python for easy experimentation. It demonstrates:

- Writing efficient C++ code for ML tasks
- Creating Python bindings with pybind11
- Using CMake to build C++ extension modules for Python

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake >= 3.14
- Python 3.x
- pybind11 (can be installed via pip: `pip install pybind11`)
